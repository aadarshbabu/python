## is or is not operator is check the id in object ...
## if id in object is not equal thatsway. comperison is fail..s

# #is not operator is check the equlity between two object..
# #if two or more then tow object are not equeal then return true..

# tupel="sunday","monday"
# tupel1= "sunday","monday"," soul"

# else:
#     print("it is also a equeal ")


# # it is check the object equlity..
# # if two diffretn tuple contain same value. tuple id is also be same.. thatsway you compare.two tuple value.

# tupel="sunday","monday"

# #every list has been diffretn id thats way. you cant check equlity.. in is or is not operator..
